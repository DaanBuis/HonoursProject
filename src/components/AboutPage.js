        <p className="px-4">This application was created in order to teach JavaScript by incorporating interactive elements. In some definitions of Interactivity, especially web-related interactivity, it is said 
            to be any element that can be interacted with by either clicking, or typing. This definition would mean that clicking on a link is interactivity, or clicking on a button is interactivity. However, 
            the aims of this application is to look at interactivity with more depth, defining interactivity as elements that the user can interact with that initiates a conversation with the user. For example, a Quiz 
            is a form of interactivity as it asks the user a question, and expects a response, therefore creating a conversation. 
            The aim is to see how these specific interactive "games"/"conversations" affect your learning experience. The other web-application that you will 
            be using is W3Schools, which is a similar free to use web-application. However, their approach to interactivity is different, with a coding sandbox as their main feature. The 
            idea of this research is not to compare the two applications, but to rather gather data on the different interactive approaches.   </p>
